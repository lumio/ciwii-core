==========

This project is way out of date. It started as a school-project in 2009. I thought of creating simple Blog-system or even a simple CMS with various content types. This would have made it very simple to manage and expand your website.

Many platforms are using a simple UX already which made this project more or less useless.

Anyway, if you want to see a demo of this project, there is still one out there at [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9v4UqGcrRA).

If you find this project still useful, you are free to fork it. If you want you can even let me know.

And if you are on the way looking for a good blogging system, here is some advertisement from me for you:

* [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com)
* [WordPress](http://wordpress.com)

If you are searching for a good CMS:

* [Drupal](http://drupal.org)

Thanks for coming by,
