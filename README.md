This project is way out of date. It started as a school-project in 2009. I thought of creating a simple Blog-system or even a simple CMS with various content types. This would have made it very simple and easy to manage and expand your website.

Many platforms are using a simple UI already which made this project more or less useless.

Anyway, if you want to see a quick demo of this project, there is still one out there on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9v4UqGcrRA).

If you think this project could be still useful, you are free to fork it. If you want you can even let me know.

And if you are on the way looking for a good blogging system, here is some advertisement from me for you:

* [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com)
* [Ghost](https://ghost.org)
* [WordPress](http://wordpress.com)

If you are searching for a good CMS:

* [Drupal](http://drupal.org)

Thanks for reading so far,
